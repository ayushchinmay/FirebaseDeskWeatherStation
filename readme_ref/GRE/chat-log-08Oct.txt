For this exam you will be allowed to use one of the following to take notes: a small portable whiteboard, or one blank sheet of paper in a transparency sleeve, with a dry erase marker. All writing must be erased upon the completion of your exam. 

You are not permitted to use any unauthorized materials, including all mobile devices, prewritten notes or textbooks at any time during the exam.   

Any unpermitted breaks will result in the exam being shut down.  

 
You are not allowed to access your mobile phone during the exam or accommodated exam breaks. 

Please note that all headphones, smartwatches, face masks, and jewelry such as large necklaces, tie clips, cuff links, ornate clips, combs, barrettes, headbands, and any additional hair accessories must be removed prior to entering the exam per ETS policy.  Wedding and engagement rings may remain on. 

If you are unwilling or unable to comply with the GRE program policies, you may not continue with your exam. Please refer to the ETS policies and procedures provided on the At Home testing site: https://www.ets.org/gre/test-takers/general-test/register/at-home-testing.html 

If the room you are testing in has a doorway, you should reposition your tabletop and chair so that the doorway is behind you, closed, and visible, otherwise you will need to relocate to an alternate testing area. Non-compliance may result in reporting of the behavior to ETS. 

Misconduct of any kind may result in a score delay, score cancellation, or a ban from taking future ETS tests.  

If you need to use the restroom before the exam is launched, please do so at this time.
